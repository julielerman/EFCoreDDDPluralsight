# Pluralsight EF Core 8 and DDD
This set of demos goes with my EF Core and Domain-Driven Design course updated in Feb 2024.  
[bit.ly/EFCore8DDD](https://bit.ly/EFCore8DDD)

While DDD is focused on the domain, data persistence is still important to your application workflow. This course will teach you how to use Entity Framework Core effectively to persist data from their DDD designed software. Additionally the course provides a review of DDD basics and the process of modeling the domain used in the samples. The final solution is an end-to-end solution incorporating multiple bounded contexts.

The samples use EF Core 8 and .NET 8. The course also points out differences for earlier versions back to EF Core 6.
