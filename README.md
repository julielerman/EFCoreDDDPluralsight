# Pluralsight EF Core 8 and DDD
This set of demos goes with my EF Core and Domain-Driven Design course updated in Feb 2024.  
[bit.ly/EFCore8DDD](https://bit.ly/EFCore8DDD)
(pluralsight.com/courses/ef-core-6-domain-driven-design)

While DDD is focused on the domain, data persistence is still important to your application workflow. This course will teach you how to use Entity Framework Core effectively to persist data from their DDD designed software.

The samples use EF Core 8 and .NET 8. The course also points out diferences for earlier versions back to EF Core 6.
